# Create a class called Player.
# Every player should have four attributes: gold_coins, health_points, and lives.
# lives should start at 5.
# gold_coins should start at 0.
# health_points should start at 10.
# Your class should have an instance method called level_up that increases lives by one.
# Your class should have an instance method called collect_treasure that increases gold_coins by one. If gold_coins is a multiple of ten (eg, 10, 20, 30, and so on) then the collect_treasure method should run the level_up method.
# Your class should have an instance method called do_battle that accepts one damage argument and subtracts it from the player's health_points. If health_points falls below one, subtract one from lives and reset health_points to ten. If you have run out of lives, this method should run another method called restart (see below).
# The restart instance method should set all attributes back to their starting values (5, 0, and 10).

    @name = name
    @gold_coins = gold_coins
